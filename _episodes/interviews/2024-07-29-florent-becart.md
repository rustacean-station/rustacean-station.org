[Florent Bécart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florent-becart-89942922/), CTO at [Nikulipe](https://nikulipe.com/), 
sits down with Luca Palmieri.

Florent discusses Nikulipe's reasons for adopting Rust: lower operational costs, scalability, safety, security and 
maintainability. Nikulipe has also made a bet on Rust for its frontend development needs, using Yew and WebAssembly.  
The interview closes with an overview of the challenges they faced, including long compile times and workspace management.
