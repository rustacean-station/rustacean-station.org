In this episode, host Gábor Szabó talks to [Eli Shalom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elishalom/), Eureka Labs' Co-Founder and CTO, and Senior Software Engineer [Igal Tabachnik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igaltabachnik/) about how Rust is powering infrastructure at [Eureka Labs](https://eurekalabs.xyz/) - a blockchain company operating in a low-latency, high-throughput environment.

Eureka Labs' work focuses on advancing the logic of block construction to support more efficient execution and expand the functionality that can be packed into each block's limited timeframe.
